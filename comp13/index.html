Steps: 
    1. Create your @keyframe and name it
    2. Add the name of your animation to div you want to change (bind it)
        a. use shorthand or all properties, must include duration
        div {
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 5s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}

@keyframes myfirst {
  0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
  25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
  50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
  75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
  100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
}

                    <h2>Transformations</h2>
                    <p>This page demonstrates the basics of employing the transform property 
                        in CSS.</p>
                    <p>Summary: There are two basic steps for writing an animation: <br>
                       a. write your animation properties on the element to animate and include the 
                       name of the corresponding keyframe<br>
                       b. write your @keyframe process and name it.<br>
                       The animation syntax goes in the element and is 
                        typically applied immediately like transform. If using
                        psuedo elements, put animation statements under pseduo class. 
                    </p>
    
                    <div class="tutorial">
                            
                            <h3>Animations</h3>
                            <p class="step">1. Hover over this box and it will rotate as long
                                as you are hovering. This animation has all the animation 
                                properties listed under the :hover pseudo class.
                            </p>

                            
                            <div id="box1"><div id="box1_1">This box uses the rotate45 keyframe</div></div>

                            <div class="row">
                                <p class="step">2. Hover over this box. There are 2 cycles
                                        of animation that happen. The cycles are set 
                                        on an alternate-reverse cycle. This animation employs a number of
                                        transform properties at different percentages
                                        of time of the 3s animation. The animation is written
                                        using shorthand in the :hover pseudo class.
                                    </p>

                            <div id="box1c"></div>

                                <p class="step">3. Hover over this box. Notice that there 
                                    are other properties besides transform that can change
                                    during an animation. The animation is written
                                        using shorthand in the :hover pseudo class.
